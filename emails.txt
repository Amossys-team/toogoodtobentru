Hello !
Are you still a crypto nut?
My manager made a mistake (on a Friday night, can you imagine that?), and I need help.
I enclosed the attachments with this mail.

I'll buy you a beer sometime if you can help.

See you!

Dave

I have some trouble and I really need you help.
I deleted the original document for security (it is confidential)
and I don't have the keys neither.

I give you the file and here is the public key:

File `confidential.pdf` has been encrypted using the following public key:
Public key: 5cd2f4202d4c791ada869a78de10db729dedb30f7bd271467ba9bd32dd643f27609395b08b8603060c2dad15317d716990d3ba20b7e5896eb3c65e98e16afe957e56f509f1cc22f88e450458b9a3ee436058b1a07332d90f471e8269e2441d3d23173d8ffc75854c419c77ee10c2ab02c697016420be7bfe6353f6866284232126ce053dc6f9b5252d9f30b6c661cbd4ed88c7abf3bf0b0d

I really need to retrive the file, it is urgent!
Can you do that?
