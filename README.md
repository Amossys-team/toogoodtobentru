# Too Good to be NTRU

This challenge was proposed for the **European Cyber Week** pre-qualification CTF,
in the cryptography category.


## Description

The original description proposed for the challenge is given below.


> Quantum computers might be coming soon and the Chied Officer of Security Information of Amossax is worried.
> He asks the manager of development teams to introduce new cryptographic algorithms in their system to face this threat.
> One manager asks his developper Dave Lopper to propose a solution in one week.
> Mr Lopper works on it and exchanges emails with his manager.
> However, the manager has issues...


You are given the following files:
- `confidential.enc`: an encrypted file;
- `emails.txt`: emails exchanged;
- `source/`: the source code proposed by the developper.

The flag is in the decrypted flag under the format `ECW{XXX}` where `XXX`
is the content of the flag.

Good luck!
